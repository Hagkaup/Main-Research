\section{Adaptive radiation}

Key to adaptive radiation is the notion of a monophyletic group with ancestral influence on adaptive traits. For example, the ancestral state should be flexible in terms of trais and that may open up for new niches or resources to be exploited (e.g. flexible stem model).

There are binary radiations. Effectively, species pairs that repeatedly arise in similar environments ``replicate radiation''. This ancestral trait variation (flexibility) may be a behavioural predisposition as is proposed in examples of resource polymorphisms.
