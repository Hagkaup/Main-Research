If itâ€™s your first push to a repo then you should use that command to tell it what branch to start saving tracking to:

git push -u origin master


Adding a file:

git add <filename> <another file> <third file>

Or, adding all files:

git add *

Then commit my changes:

git commit -m "these are the git details to familiarize myself with the system"

Save the changes and push:

git push
